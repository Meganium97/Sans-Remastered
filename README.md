# Sans-Remastered
Basically Sans but remastered.
It serves a whole new purpose now that the [original snas](https://github.com/Lazr1026/Sans) has been archived.
Open to PR's. I'm still figuring out how to do python so the userphone errors out upon a message sent.
### Instructions - selfhosting
1. Install [Python3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or newer.
2. Install everything in requirements.txt with `pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt` (if this fails try `pip3 install -r path/to/requirements.txt`)
3. Place the token in a file called `token.json` in the same directory as `sans.py`, then run `sans.py`.
Enjoy hosting Sans(-Remastered)!
